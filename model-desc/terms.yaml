    Origin: caDSR
    Definition: A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma
      is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries
      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      the vast majority of cholangiocarcinomas are adenocarcinomas showing tubular

  Liver - Hepatocellular carcinoma:
    Origin: caDSR
    Definition: 'A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma
      is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries
      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.: A triangular-shaped organ
      located under the diaphragm in the right hypochondrium. It is the largest internal
