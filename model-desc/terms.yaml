      is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine
      pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy.
      The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all
      over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these
      areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises
      the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells
      make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little
      is known.'
